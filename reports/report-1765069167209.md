## 📈 Overall Experience

### Score: 7/10 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

The FinPlan app provides a comprehensive overview of personal finances with clear visualizations and organized sections. However, some usability issues such as unclear budget overspending indicators and potential accessibility barriers could hinder the experience for users like Maria.

---

## 🐛 Usability Issues Found


### Issue 1: MEDIUM

**Description:** Budget categories like 'Food & Dining' show overspending (e.g., $480 spent vs $400 budget) but lack clear visual alerts to highlight this issue.

**Recommendation:** Add color-coded indicators or alerts to immediately draw attention to budget overruns.


### Issue 2: MEDIUM

**Description:** Some buttons such as 'Add Transaction' and '+ Add Goal' are represented with images and text but may lack sufficient descriptive labels for screen readers.

**Recommendation:** Ensure all actionable buttons have accessible labels and tooltips for assistive technologies.


### Issue 3: LOW

**Description:** The navigation links (Dashboard, Transactions, Budgets, Goals, Reports) are text-based but could benefit from clearer focus indicators for keyboard navigation.

**Recommendation:** Implement visible focus styles to improve keyboard navigation clarity.

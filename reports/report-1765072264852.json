  "accessibilityNotes": [
    "No explicit mention of screen reader support or ARIA labels; unclear if images and icons have alt text.",
    "Color contrast and font sizes appear adequate but should be verified for users with visual impairments.",
    "Keyboard navigation is possible but focus indicators on navigation links and buttons could be improved for clarity.",
    "Some financial data is presented only visually (e.g., graphs) which may not be fully accessible without text alternatives."
  ],
  "personaSpecificFeedback": "As Maria, who values clarity and ease of use, I appreciate the detailed financial summaries and goal tracking features. However, I find it a bit challenging to understand when I have overspent in certain budget categories because there are no clear alerts. Also, some buttons like 'Add Transaction' could be more intuitive with explanations. Improved keyboard navigation and clearer focus indicators would help me navigate more confidently.",

    "Add descriptive tooltips or labels to buttons and interactive elements to improve discoverability and ease of use.",
    "Enhance keyboard navigation by improving focus indicators on links and buttons for better accessibility.",
    "Ensure all images and icons have meaningful alt text for screen reader users.",

      "severity": "medium",
      "description": "Budget categories such as 'Food & Dining' show expenses exceeding the budget without clear warnings or alerts, which may confuse users.",

    {
      "severity": "medium",
      "description": "Some financial terms and percentages (e.g., savings rate, credit usage) lack explanatory tooltips or definitions, which may be challenging for users unfamiliar with financial jargon.",

    {
      "severity": "low",
      "description": "The 'Add Goal' button is present but not prominently highlighted, which might reduce discoverability for users wanting to set new savings goals.",

  "usabilityIssues": [
    {
      "severity": "medium",
      "description": "Budget categories like Food & Dining show expenses exceeding the budget (e.g., $480 spent vs $400 budgeted) without clear alerts or guidance.",
      "recommendation": "Add clear visual warnings or notifications when spending exceeds budget limits to help users manage finances better."
    },
    {
      "severity": "medium",
      "description": "Some financial data and charts lack descriptive labels or tooltips, which may confuse users unfamiliar with financial terms or visualizations.",
      "recommendation": "Include explanatory tooltips or labels for charts and financial metrics to improve understanding."
    },
    {
      "severity": "low",
      "description": "The navigation links (Dashboard, Transactions, Budgets, Goals, Reports) are present but their current state or selection is not visually distinct.",
      "recommendation": "Enhance navigation feedback by highlighting the active section to improve orientation within the app."
    }
  ],
  "positiveAspects": [

  ],
  "accessibilityNotes": [
    "No explicit mention of screen reader support or keyboard navigation cues; important for users with visual impairments like Maria.",
    "Color contrast and font sizes appear adequate but should be verified to meet accessibility standards for users with low vision.",
    "Icons and images lack alternative text descriptions, which may hinder screen reader users.",
    "The app should ensure all interactive elements are reachable and operable via keyboard for users with motor impairments."
  ],
  "personaSpecificFeedback": "As Maria, who values clear and accessible financial information, I find the app generally helpful but sometimes overwhelming due to dense data presentation and lack of clear alerts when budgets are exceeded. I would appreciate more guidance and explanations for financial terms and visualizations, as well as improved accessibility features like screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation.",
  "recommendations": [
    "Implement clear visual alerts when spending exceeds budget limits to help users stay on track.",
    "Add descriptive tooltips and labels for charts and financial metrics to aid user understanding.",
    "Enhance navigation by visually indicating the current active section.",
    "Improve accessibility by adding alternative text for images and icons, ensuring keyboard navigability, and verifying color contrast compliance.",
    "Consider adding a tutorial or help section explaining financial terms and app features for users less familiar with financial planning apps."

## 📈 Overall Experience

### Score: 7/10 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

The FinPlan app provides a comprehensive overview of personal finances with clear visualizations and organized sections for net worth, income, expenses, budgets, and savings goals. While the interface is generally intuitive, some budget categories and transaction details could be clearer to enhance user understanding and navigation.

## 🐛 Usability Issues Found


### Issue 1: MEDIUM

**Description:** Budget categories such as 'Food & Dining' show expenses exceeding the budget without clear warnings or alerts, which may confuse users.

**Recommendation:** Add visual indicators or alerts when spending exceeds budget limits to help users quickly identify overspending.


### Issue 2: MEDIUM

**Description:** Some financial terms and percentages (e.g., savings rate, credit usage) lack explanatory tooltips or definitions, which may be challenging for users unfamiliar with financial jargon.

**Recommendation:** Include tooltips or brief explanations for financial terms to improve user comprehension.


### Issue 3: LOW

**Description:** The 'Add Goal' button is present but not prominently highlighted, which might reduce discoverability for users wanting to set new savings goals.

**Recommendation:** Enhance the visibility of the 'Add Goal' button with distinct colors or positioning.

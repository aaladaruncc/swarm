### Score: 7/10 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

## 🐛 Usability Issues Found


### Issue 1: MEDIUM

**Description:** Budget categories like 'Food & Dining' show expenses exceeding the budget without clear alerts or guidance.

**Recommendation:** Implement clearer warnings or suggestions when spending exceeds budget limits.


### Issue 2: MEDIUM

**Description:** Some financial terms and percentages (e.g., savings rate, credit usage) may not be immediately understandable to all users.

**Recommendation:** Add tooltips or brief explanations for financial metrics to aid user understanding.


### Issue 3: LOW

**Description:** The navigation links (Dashboard, Transactions, Budgets, Goals, Reports) are not visually distinct enough to quickly identify the current section.

**Recommendation:** Highlight the active navigation link to improve orientation within the app.

## 💭 Persona-Specific Feedback

I would appreciate more guidance on what the percentages mean and clearer notifications when I overspend in a category. Also, ensuring the app is fully accessible with screen readers and keyboard navigation is important for my comfort and confidence in managing finances."

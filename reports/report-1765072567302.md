## 📈 Overall Experience

### Score: 7/10 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

The FinPlan app provides a comprehensive overview of personal finances with clear sections for net worth, income, expenses, budgets, and savings goals. The interface is visually organized and offers useful financial insights, but some areas could be improved for better usability and accessibility.

## 🐛 Usability Issues Found


### Issue 1: MEDIUM

**Description:** Budget categories like Food & Dining show expenses exceeding the budget (e.g., $480 spent vs $400 budgeted) without clear alerts or guidance.

**Recommendation:** Add clear visual warnings or notifications when spending exceeds budget limits to help users manage finances better.


### Issue 2: MEDIUM

**Description:** Some financial data and charts lack descriptive labels or tooltips, which may confuse users unfamiliar with financial terms or visualizations.

**Recommendation:** Include explanatory tooltips or labels for charts and financial metrics to improve understanding.


### Issue 3: LOW

**Description:** The navigation links (Dashboard, Transactions, Budgets, Goals, Reports) are present but their current state or selection is not visually distinct.

**Recommendation:** Enhance navigation feedback by highlighting the active section to improve orientation within the app.

## ♿ Accessibility Notes

- No explicit mention of screen reader support or keyboard navigation cues; important for users with visual impairments like Maria.
- Color contrast and font sizes appear adequate but should be verified to meet accessibility standards for users with low vision.
- Icons and images lack alternative text descriptions, which may hinder screen reader users.
- The app should ensure all interactive elements are reachable and operable via keyboard for users with motor impairments.

## 💭 Persona-Specific Feedback

> "As Maria, who values clear and accessible financial information, I find the app generally helpful but sometimes overwhelming due to dense data presentation and lack of clear alerts when budgets are exceeded. I would appreciate more guidance and explanations for financial terms and visualizations, as well as improved accessibility features like screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation."

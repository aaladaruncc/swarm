      "description": "Budget categories like 'Food & Dining' show overspending (e.g., $480 spent vs $400 budget) but lack clear visual alerts to highlight this issue.",

    },
    {
      "severity": "medium",
      "description": "Some buttons such as 'Add Transaction' and '+ Add Goal' are represented with images and text but may lack sufficient descriptive labels for screen readers.",
      "recommendation": "Ensure all actionable buttons have accessible labels and tooltips for assistive technologies."
    },
    {
      "severity": "low",
      "description": "The navigation links (Dashboard, Transactions, Budgets, Goals, Reports) are text-based but could benefit from clearer focus indicators for keyboard navigation.",

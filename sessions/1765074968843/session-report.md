## 📈 Overall Experience

### Score: 5/10 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

I clicked on "Dashboard" and now I'm back to the main dashboard page with "Good morning, John" at the top.  I can see the same financial overview information with the Total Net Worth of $127,845.  This is quite overwhelming for me as a beginner - all these large numbers and financial terms like "Cash & Savings", "Investments", "Property" and "Liabilities" are confusing for someone like me who just wants simple help with budgeting and saving for my children's education.

## 💭 Persona-Specific Feedback

> "Good! I clicked on "Dashboard" and now I'm back to the main dashboard page with "Good morning, John" at the top.

This is quite overwhelming for me as a beginner - all these large numbers and financial terms like "Cash & Savings", "Investments", "Property" and "Liabilities" are confusing for someone like me who just wants simple help with budgeting and saving for my children's education.

I can also see the familiar monthly metrics: Monthly Income $4,500, Monthly Expenses $2,175, Savings Rate 51.7%, and Credit Usage 23%. As someone from Brazil, these dollar amounts seem very high, and terms like "Savings Rate" and "Credit Usage" need simpler explanations for me to understand.

Let me scroll down to see the more visual and helpful sections that I found easier to understand before."

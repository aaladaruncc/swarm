### Quick Assessment
I clicked on "Dashboard" and now I'm back to the main dashboard page with "Good morning, John" at the top.  I can see the same financial overview information with the Total Net Worth of $127,845.  This is quite overwhelming for me as a beginner - all these large numbers and financial terms like "Cash & Savings", "Investments", "Property" and "Liabilities" are confusing for someone like me who just wants simple help with budgeting and saving for my children's education.

## 🧠 User's Complete Journey & Thoughts

The following is the complete stream of consciousness from Maria as they explored the application:

Good! I clicked on "Dashboard" and now I'm back to the main dashboard page with "Good morning, John" at the top. I can see the same financial overview information with the Total Net Worth of $127,845. This is quite overwhelming for me as a beginner - all these large numbers and financial terms like "Cash & Savings", "Investments", "Property" and "Liabilities" are confusing for someone like me who just wants simple help with budgeting and saving for my children's education.

I can also see the familiar monthly metrics: Monthly Income $4,500, Monthly Expenses $2,175, Savings Rate 51.7%, and Credit Usage 23%. As someone from Brazil, these dollar amounts seem very high, and terms like "Savings Rate" and "Credit Usage" need simpler explanations for me to understand.

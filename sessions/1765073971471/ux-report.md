## 🧠 User's Complete Journey & Thoughts

The following is the complete stream of consciousness from Maria as they explored the application:

I clicked on "Budgets" and can see it's highlighted in the navigation menu, but I'm back at the top of the same dashboard page again. This is the same pattern I've been seeing - all navigation items seem to just scroll to different sections of this one page.

I can see the main financial overview clearly now:
- The greeting still says "Good morning, John" with a waving hand emoji
- "Here's an overview of your finances for December 2024"
- Total Net Worth: $127,845 with +12.5% growth (+$14,250 this year)

The breakdown in the dark blue section shows:
- Cash & Savings: $24,500
- Investments: $68,340 (this is the largest portion!)
- Property: $45,000
- Liabilities: -$9,995 (shown in red, representing debts)

Below that, the monthly summary shows:
- Monthly Income: $4,500 (+5.2% vs last month)
- Monthly Expenses: $2,175 (-8.1% vs last month)
- Savings Rate: 51.7% (+3.4% vs last month)
- Credit Usage: 23% (-2.1% vs last month)

The high savings rate of 51.7% is really impressive! That means more than half of the income is being saved, which is amazing for someone trying to save for education like me. Let me scroll down one more time to see if there are specific budget details since I clicked on "Budgets".
